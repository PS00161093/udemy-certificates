# udemy-certificates
The repository contains all self-learnings & certifications I have achieved using Udemy.<BR>
My method of self-learning involves reading books, taking online courses, watching tutorials & doing proof of concepts (POCs).<BR>
I then implement the learned knowledge into the real world projects.
